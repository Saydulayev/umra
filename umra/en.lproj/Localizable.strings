Drink water and pour it over your head.
    
Jabir (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated: «The Prophet (peace be upon him) went to the well of Zamzam, drank from it and poured it over his head.» This hadith is authentic, and it is reported in Ahmad (3/394), Ibn Khuzaymah (4/305). The authenticity of the hadith is confirmed by az-Zarkashi, Badr al-Din al-Ayni, and Shu'ayb al-Arnaut. See «Umdat al-Qari» (9/227), «Hashiya 'ala al-Manasik» (p. 263), «Tahridj al-Musnad» (15243).
    
From the words of Jabir (may Allah be pleased with him), it is reported that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: «The water of Zamzam helps to achieve what it is drunk for.» This hadith is reported in Ahmad (3/357), Ibn Majah (3062), and Al-Hakim (1739). The authenticity of the hadith has been confirmed by scholars such as Sufyan ibn 'Uyaynah, Al-Munziri, Ad-Dumyati, Ibn Al-Qayyim, Az-Zarkashi, Ibn Hajar, and Al-Albani. See «Al-Mudjalasa» (509), «Al-Matjar Ar-Rabih» (982), «Zadul-Ma'ad» (4/393), «Al-Maqasid Al-Hasanah» (928), «Faidul-Qadir» (7759), and «Sahih At-Targhib» (1165).
    
Ash-Shawkani said: «This hadith contains evidence that drinking Zamzam water is beneficial for the drinker, no matter what intention they have, whether it is for the affairs of this world or the Hereafter. The words 'it serves the purpose for which it is drunk' are general in meaning.» See «Nayl al-Awtar» (5/105).
An-Nawawi said: «The meaning of this hadith is that whoever drinks this water for a specific purpose, will attain it. Truly, scholars and righteous people have tried this to achieve their needs, whether in this world or the Hereafter, and they have received it by the grace of Almighty Allah.» See «Tahzib al-asma wa al-lughat» (3/139).";

Then descend from the hill of Safa and head towards the hill of Marwa, beginning the ritual passage. One passage from Safa to Marwa is considered as one complete round.

On the hill of Marwa, you should repeat the same actions as on the hill of Safa: face the Kaaba, say the takbirs and the testimony of faith, and supplicate to Allah. Upon reaching the first marked point, indicated by a green sign, men are required to jog to the second marked point. The rest of the way is completed at a normal walking pace.
