The authenticity of the hadith is confirmed by az-Zarkashi, Badr al-Din al-Ayni, and Shu'ayb al-Arnaut.

See «Al-Mudjalasa» (509), «Al-Matjar Ar-Rabih» (982), «Zadul-Ma'ad» (4/393), «Al-Maqasid Al-Hasanah» (928), «Faidul-Qadir» (7759), and «Sahih At-Targhib» (1165).
    
Ash-Shawkani said: «This hadith contains evidence that drinking Zamzam water is beneficial for the drinker, no matter what intention they have, whether it is for the affairs of this world or the Hereafter. The words 'it serves the purpose for which it is drunk' are general in meaning.» See «Nayl al-Awtar» (5/105).
An-Nawawi said: «The meaning of this hadith is that whoever drinks this water for a specific purpose, will attain it.

At the top of Marwa, repeat the same pattern: zikr — dua — zikr — dua — zikr, raising your hands for dua after the first and second recitations. This zikr and dua should be repeated every time you ascend Safa or Marwa, except for the seventh and final round.

/* Texts for Hajj and Umrah Obligation */
"hajj_umrah_obligation_obligation_evidence" = "Performing Hajj and ‘Umrah is obligatory once in a lifetime, and whoever performs them more than once, it is considered voluntary worship.

Hajj and ‘Umrah also become obligatory if one makes a vow (nazr). If a person vows to Allah to perform Hajj or ‘Umrah, they must fulfill their vow.

If a person begins performing a voluntary Hajj or ‘Umrah, they are required to complete it, as Allah said: «Complete the Hajj and ‘Umrah for Allah.» (Surah Al-Baqarah, Ayah 196)

The obligation of performing Hajj is established by evidence from the Qur’an, the Sunnah, and the consensus (ijma‘) of Muslims.  
Allah the Exalted said: «Pilgrimage to the House (Ka‘bah) is a duty owed to Allah by people who are able to undertake it. And if anyone refuses to obey, then indeed Allah has no need of the worlds.» (Surah Aal ‘Imran, Ayah 97)

The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: «Islam is built upon five (pillars): the testimony that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, establishing prayer, paying zakat, performing Hajj, and fasting during Ramadan.» Al-Bukhari 8, Muslim 16.

He also said: «Islam is to bear witness that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, to establish prayer, to give zakat, to fast during Ramadan, and to perform Hajj to the House if you are able to do so.» Muslim 8.

It is also reported that Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, said: «The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, once addressed us and said: «O people, Hajj has been made obligatory upon you, so perform it.» A man asked, «Every year, O Messenger of Allah?» The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, remained silent until the man repeated the question three times. Then the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: «If I were to say ‘Yes,’ it would become obligatory upon you, but you would not be able to do it.» Muslim 1337.

The Muslim community unanimously agrees that Hajj is obligatory for anyone who meets all the conditions for its obligation.";

2 — It is reported from ‘Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, that the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: «The essence of Islam is to bear witness that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allah, and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, to establish prayer, to give zakat, to perform Hajj and ‘Umrah, to perform the major purification after sexual impurity, to perform minor ablution properly, and to fast during Ramadan.» See «Sahih Ibn Khuzaymah,» Hadith No. 3065. This hadith is also found in Ad-Daraqutni 2/282.

3 — It is reported from Abu Razin Al-‘Uqayli that he once came to the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, and said: «O Messenger of Allah, my father is very old and cannot perform Hajj or ‘Umrah, nor can he sit firmly in a saddle.» The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, replied: «Perform Hajj and ‘Umrah on behalf of your father.» At-Tirmidhi 930.

4 — It is reported from As-Subay‘ bin Ma‘bad that he once said to ‘Umar ibn Al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him: «O Commander of the Believers, I was a Bedouin and practiced Christianity. Then I embraced Islam. I aspire to participate in jihad, but I found that Hajj and ‘Umrah have been prescribed for me. I asked one of my people about it, and he said to me: “Perform Hajj and ‘Umrah together and offer a sacrifice from what is easy for you,” and I performed them together.» ‘Umar then said: «You have been guided to the Sunnah of your Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him.» Abu Dawood 1799.";
